## Heavy WIP Warning
 This branch is a complete rewrite with many breaking changes. Not only does it use the rewrite branch of discord.py, everything has been redesigned and reimplemented (hopefully much more cleanly). Most functionality will come back as development progresses, but may work differently.
 
 # Weeabot
 Discord bot used in personal servers.
 
 Currently, the bot has no public hosted version. You will need to download and host your own instance.
 
 Requires Python 3.6 or higher
