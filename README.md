## Heavy WIP Warning
This branch is a complete rewrite with many breaking changes. Not only does it use the rewrite branch of discord.py, everything has been redesigned and reimplemented (hopefully much more cleanly). Most functionality will come back as development progresses, but may work differently.

Things will change often. Things won't always work. Things will almost always be experimental. This branch has no real setup guide nor will it for quite a while. However, this is the version of the bot most "current" and I keep a running instance of it.

# Weeabot
Discord bot used in personal servers.

Currently, the bot has no public hosted version. You will need to download and host your own instance.

Requires Python 3.6 or higher
