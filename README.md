Currently, the bot has no public hosted version. You will need to download and host your own instance.

# Requires:

    * This is the heart of the bot. Absolutely required.
* https://github.com/Damgaard/PyImgur
    * Used in several commands in the 'images' cog to get images and albums from imgur. You can skip this requirement if you disable the 'images' cog.
* https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow
    * Used to edit images in the 'images' cog. You can skip this requirement if you disable the 'images' cog.
* https://github.com/folz/cleverbot.py
